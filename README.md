# RITA Scripts

 Here are a collection of scripts to make it easier to extract more intelligence from RITA output.


### Finding the AS number of hosts with high beacon scores
- doing reverse lookups on the beacons is a pain and often doesn't return anything interesting. 
- This is a quick script to let you narrow down beaconish originators using the AS number, which is more stable.

As in this example many things that look beaconish are actually DNS calls or Corporate Services. 


```
for x in `rita show-beacons myhost|grep -v Source |awk -F, '{if ($1 > .8) print $3}'`; do echo "$x: $(whois -h whois.cymru.com " -v $x"| grep -v BGP)"; done

## Notebooks
**Evaluating traffic on an external webserver**  
Watching public traffic to see if a local c2 has been installed and determine which regions are accessing services.

- added a feature if an IP has a DNS entry or is correctly configured with a reverse
- incorporated fail2ban entries

TODO:
- speed up the AS feature creation by creating a global AS dictionary to feed the features
- sum and sort by score to determine mystery nodes vs "well mannered" nodes
- summarize into dashboard

**Evaluating traffic from a office or home LAN**  
Here we want to mostly determine beacon-like normal services (DNS to known providers), callbacks to corporate services we expect (Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc) and others to narrow down what likely C2 or non-expected traffic is egressing. 

TODO:
- formalize True Positives
- extract report from connections

### Exporatory Data Analysis of external traffic

Here are a few examples of visualizing what the state of the connections look like. 
- by AS
- by Country
- Relative percentage of traffic connection duration
- Relative percentage of traffic that gets classified as a beacon by RITA
- a heatmap of statistical correlations
- types of protocols, etc


- What AS Regions are generating the most connections?

- What is the relative occurance of high percentage beaconish activity?

### Tools

There are some script tools added to make some lookups and data import easier.

**bash lookups for ASNs**

Simple shell wrappers to return the AS numbers of beaconish activity

- get_beacon_AS.sh
- get_long_connections_asn.sh

**Data preparation for the notebook visualizations**

- obscureips.py -  A python script to obscure LAN ip addresses if you are presenting or sharing your output
- rita_extractor.sh - a wrapper to gather long_connections and beacons into named files for origin scrubbing and import into the notebook
