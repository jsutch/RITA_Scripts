 Here are a collection of scripts to make it easier to extract more intelligence from RITA output.


### Finding the AS number of hosts with high beacon scores
- doing reverse lookups on the beacons is a pain and often doesn't return anything interesting. 
- This is a quick script to let you narrow down beaconish originators using the AS number, which is more stable.

As in this example many things that look beaconish are actually DNS calls or Corporate Services. 


```
for x in `rita show-beacons myhost|grep -v Source |awk -F, '{if ($1 > .8) print $3}'`; do echo "$x: $(whois -h whois.cymru.com " -v $x"| grep -v BGP)"; done
