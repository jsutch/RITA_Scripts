    " RITA and Zeek are fantastic tools to explore traffic and narrow down bad actors but published blacklists are always laggy and incomplete, when they work and are supported. Also - the scoring doesn't filter for items like DNS or other probable-good services (or call them out), which adds to the SecOps response time to filter.  Here we can bring some low-cost tools to bear and some local understanding to narrow down what to invest time into, good or bad.\n",

    "- Combine Beacons and Conns files to identify unique talkers\n",

    "\n",
    "**Quick BGP/AS intro (stolen liberally from Cloudflare's great tutorial):**  \n",
    "The *Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)* is the postal service of the Internet. To manage these endpoints each network broken into smaller networks known as *Autonomous systems (AS)*. Each of these networks is essentially a large pool of routers run by a single organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we continue to think of BGP as the postal service of the Internet, AS’s are like individual post office branches. A town may have hundreds of mailboxes, but the mail in those boxes must go through the local postal branch before being routed to another destination. The internal routers within an AS are like mailboxes, they forward their outbound transmissions to the AS, which then uses BGP routing to get these transmissions to their destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get on the Internet you need an IP Block, which needs a BGP AS. The companies that own the AS are responsible for the traffic that goes through them. If you have a lot of bad traffic coming from one server in an AS then there's reason to believe that blocks in other IP space controlled by that AS are also probably poorly managed. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading traffic from a particular AS block**  \n",
    "This may be part of a decision to drop traffic coming from a single server or from the entire IP space as a Network Admin, but in this context we're simply going to grade traffic to that AS as more suspicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading traffic coming from a Country**\n",
    "Each BGP area is controlled within a Region, which then distributes to countries who have laws regarding internet traffic, hacking, etc. Some countries are more permissive than others with regard to hacking, fraud and spam. While it's incorrect and unfair to grade the citizens or services of a country based on the worst of their netizens, it's reasonable to grade countries with overly promiscuous (or non-existent) laws about hacking higher for further review. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading traffic coming from a Company**  \n",
    "Much of the same rules apply here - if a company has a policy for their devices to send tracking data home through your networks you should be able to know about it. If they have lax policies concerning network access or services that could host C2 or bad traffic, you should be able to know about that, too. "
